### Simulated_Data_Analysis_Final.R

This file contains code for the analysis of proximal and distal effects in a hybrid SMART-MRT design. It pulls from the file "Hanna_Estimator_Resp.R" to perform the proximal analysis.

### sim_data_for_proximal.R

This file contains simulated data for the proximal analysis. It includes responders and nonresponders.

### sim_data_for_distal_responders_only.R

This file contains simulated data for the distal analysis. It includes only responders.

### Hanna_Estimator_Resp.R

This file contains code for the estimation equation for a binary outcome used for the proximal effect analysis. It has been adapted from Tianchen Qian and Jamie Yap.
